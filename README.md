# Temperature-Display-Project
This project reads temperature data from a TMP36 temperature sensor using an Arduino Uno and displays the temperature on four 7-segment displays in three units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The code is designed to provide an accurate reading with a precision of 0.5 degrees.

Currently, the project is a work in progress. While the basic functionality of reading temperature and displaying it on the 7-segment displays is in place, the code is not fully complete and may not work as expected in all cases.

This project was powered by Navez Thomas, who clearly knows how to keep things coolâ€”both in coding and temperature! Thanks for checking it out, and remember: keep your circuits running and your batteries charged! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”‹
