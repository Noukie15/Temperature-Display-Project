# Temperature-Display-Project
This project reads temperature data from a TMP36 temperature sensor using an Arduino Uno and displays the temperature on four 7-segment displays in three units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The code is designed to provide an accurate reading with a precision of 0.5 degrees.

Currently, the project is a work in progress. While the basic functionality of reading temperature and displaying it on the 7-segment displays is in place, the code is not fully complete and may not work as expected in all cases.

This project was powered by **Navez Thomas**, who clearly knows how to keep things coolâ€”both in coding and temperature! Thanks for checking it out, and remember: keep your circuits running and your batteries charged! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”‹

# Temperature Alarm System - Sub-Assignment with TMP36 Sensor
This project is a sub-assignment of the main project where temperature data is read from a TMP36 temperature sensor. In this sub-assignment, the Arduino reads temperature data and activates an alarm if the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold. The alarm can be manually toggled on and off by the user, allowing flexible control over the alert system.

Currently, the project is a work in progress. While the core functionalitiesâ€”reading the temperature, setting a threshold, and activating the alarmâ€”are implemented, the code may still require further adjustments to ensure reliable performance across all conditions.
